**Why are you a Christian?**

Christianity is the only meaningful life to live on this earth as far as I’m concerned. All that comes from studying and preaching and teaching about Our Lord and because He died for me. He paid a debt that I owed but I couldn’t pay it and He paid it but He didn’t owe it. He died a very horrible and humiliating death that set me free from the slavery of sin. There is a big difference between living in sin without Christ in your life and occasionally you’ll do some good but a Christian is one who is faithful and lives a godly life and occasionally will stumble in a moment of weakness or inadvertently, but he will confess that sin and that is what I John Chapter 1 is all about.

**What has the church done for you?**

The church gives me a sense of really belonging to something worthwhile and transcends this life. It is spiritual and eternal. People all over the world seem to long to be a part of some group. The devil knows that so he tries to steer them to groups that are wrong.

**What do you think of the people that don’t believe in Christianity?**

I think it is sad and tragic but it is just the wrong choice. Jesus made it very clear that there is a narrow road that leads to life everlasting and there is a broad road that leads to destruction and the majority of people are going on the wide path because they have chosen. Jesus is not willing for any to perish but that all come to repentance. He has made us free moral agents, with the ability to choose. We are not robots. We can choose the Lord or we can choose the world. My Lord died for them, which means He loved them [the lost], so I must love them and I would be willing to sacrifice and help them because I love them.

**Why do you think people don’t choose Christianity?**

The Lord created us with the ability to choose but He leaves it up to us as to what we choose. He doesn’t force us. True love doesn’t force. People choose not to follow Christianity because they are more interested in the here and now.

**What is your opinion on creation?**

I don’t have an opinion except what is taught in the word of God. It is very clear that we are created and that evolution is a false theory. Evolution is still a theory even though people want to believe it is true. The main reason people want to believe that way is because they don’t want to be told how to live and they want to be free to live any way they want to live. To me evolution doesn’t leave you with any purpose. It is just one way people live so they won’t have any restraints.

**What do you think of the idea of mixing creation with evolution?**

There is just nothing in the Bible that supports that. That is just another theory that is false. If you look at the days of creation they were 24-hour periods. God is very capable of creation. God didn’t say, “Let there be light”, and after several billion years He is still saying, “Let there be light”. He said, “Let there be light”, and it came into existence. He is that powerful. There is just no such thing as creation and then evolution.

**Jim Reeves is a great Christian role model standing up for Biblical truths. Thank you, Mr. Reeves.**
